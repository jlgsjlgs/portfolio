  introduction: `I'm Jonathan, a full-stack developer who loves building things that make people's lives easier.
                I graduated from Nanyang Technological University (NTU) in Singapore with a Bachelor of Engineering in Computer Science.
                Over the years, I've dipped my toes into various fields, from software development to AI/ML, scripting, and bot development.
                My main driving factor has always been curiosity and the constant opportunity to learn, create, and improve.`,
